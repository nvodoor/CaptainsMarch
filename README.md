### Captain's March

This is a game of Captain's March that I am developing using the Vue framework.

- Step One: Edited index.html to ensure we had a game board that corresponded to 7 columns 6 rows.
- Step Two: Created a div within index.html to display the winner when the winner was implemented. Also implemented logic to stop the game once a winner was determined.
- Step Three: Implemented logic to check to see if a row, column, or major/minor diagonal had four in a row.
- Step Four: Created computer AI. Complete Bare Minimum Requirements. 
- BMRs took me around 2 hours and 50 minutes. Major issues were configuring Gulp on my laptop. That did not work so I went with my PC instead.
