### Captain's March

This is a game of Captain's March that I am developing using the Vue framework.

-Step One: Edited index.html to ensure we had a game board that corresponded to 7 columns 6 rows.
-Step Two: Created a div within index.html to display the winner when the winner was implemented. Also implemented logic to stop the game once a winner was determined.
-Step Three: Implemented logic to check to see if a row, column, or major/minor diagonal had four in a row.
